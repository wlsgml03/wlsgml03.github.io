        <h1> About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jinhee Chang, a software developer and robotics enthusiast from Georgia Tech. 
            I’ve worked on projects in embedded systems, artificial intelligence, and robotics as well as knowing how to manage large-scale projects. 
            I love learning anything and everything about software development and project management. 
            When I’m not behind a computer screen, I enjoy trying new cafes and reading books. 
            Feel free to check out my portfolio to see my current robots and work in action!</p>
